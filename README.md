# Basic-MIPS-Assembly-Exercises
A small repo with basic MIPS assembly exercises
I wrote this probably back in 2008 while studying MIPS Assembly and Computer Architecture, the
only downside is that the comments are in multiple languages , so you'r on your own there :D

See http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~larus/spim.html for simulator on Linux, Windows or OSX.
